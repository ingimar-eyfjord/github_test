		<p>
		My name was hard to pronounce right? People also call me Ingi and I'm fine with that, I am a 25-year-old social guy from Reykjavik, Iceland. I love my life and there's no reason not to. 
		Sometimes things get hard but your life is basically the accumulation of reactions you have had to the obsticals and pressure of society's pull towards the norm.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		I love photography and designing stuff, sometimes I feel like an imposter, thinking I shouldn't be here, that I'm not good enough. But I tell myself "babes you deserve this, if your not good enough really - then fake it till you make it."
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		I am sort of well traveled, I have been to 19 countries, for some that's alot, for me that's nothing. Despite having about 70 countries in the world that don't welcome me, I still want to travel the world and see it all. What else is there.

		<h2>Typography
		</h2>
		<p>
		I chose the Futura PT typeface because most of the information displayed</p><br>
		<p>
on album covers and graphic design behind Jazz uses a simple
and rounded typeface.</p><br>
		<p>
‘Futura PT book’ has been used on many different album covers in the
past. This thickness is usually used to display information that doesn’t
need to be very attention-grabbing.</p><br>
		<p>
‘Futura PT Demi’ is a little thicker and gives more attention to the
information written.</p><br>
		<p>
‘Futura PT Bold’ is also a little thicker and also gives more
attention, this can be used to name the artists or relevant
information for the viewer.</p><br>
		<p>
‘Futura PT Extra Bold’ is the thickest one of the bunch
and has been used for the title or name of the album.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>'Bauhaus 93'</h2> 
		<p> I chose this typeface because it's very round and big. The asthetics is very different from the Futura PT typeface.</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		<h2> User-friendly</h2>
Going from the desktop version to the mobile version must retain all the necessary style traits and 
information on both platforms. The purpose of this website is to create an online Jazz community where people can read up on jazz news and articles, buy merchandise and look at the upcoming events near them and buy tickets for those events.
<br><br>
The feasibility of this kind of website is unknown to me, I haven't really looked into the jazz community itself, but for the argument's sake, let's pretend that everything will work and business is booming.<br><br>

<h2>The layout</h2>
I will have four/five main website layouts. The first one is the homepage. Where users are guided 
through the website with enticing headlines and a clear user interface design.
The other one is an article based layout, one very commonly found in news articles online, a fixed design. These will be for the articles and news items the studio will be posting.
<br><br>
Then we'll have the store, the store will be selling merchandise such as jazz albums, merch and jazz-related 
instruments w/ worldwide shipping. For argument's sake, logistically, we'd be a big company manufacturing, 
producing and shipping everything ourselves. <br>The layout of the store would be a catalogue, individual categories for each type of merchandise item i.e. were it a saxophone or a t-shirt. Category menu on the left-hand side and in each category there would the a scalable/responsive grid layout with the merchandise.<br><br>

Lastly the event’s page, that would most likely be where the business gained most revenue from. The main event’s 
page will be a “home” page in itself, where there’s going to be a calendar of upcoming events. There will be space for advertisements for upcoming events and also some articles. When you click on an event you will be directed to the landing page of that event.<br><br>

On the left hand side you will have a picture of the band and their bio, including a video or sample if they have one. In between the picture (and the band’s name) and the bands bio  you have two button options, one to buy a ticket and the other to go back to the calendar.<br><br>

On the right hand side you have a google maps crop out showing the events venue location, the venue’s name and
the date and time. Beneath that will be a clickable list to the four nearest upcoming events.
<br><br>
		<h2>The principal</h2>
<p>Everything in this design will be designed with the gestalt principle, and I want the page to be even with just as much 
negative space as content. I choose to have two distinctively different typefaces, as blue note record albums usually 
had this type of design.

	 	 <h2>The iconic work of Reid Miles</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="design-description">
				<p>
				Reid Miles was an American modernist 
designer.Best known for his iconic work with Blue Note Records, wherein themid last 
century he designed almost 500 record 
covers for the label.</p>
<br>
			<p>
Back then the style seemed outrageous, one or two colours are used and some intense graphics that give the cover an atmospheric look.</p>
<br>
				<p>
The typography design Reid used developed was thought to be very nuanced and 
unconstricted from the normal album cover arts at the time.</p>
<br>
					<p>
The graphics Reid used was mostly photographs of the artists and then overlaying graphic design. Usually, in black and white, Reid was able to capture the aesthetics of Jazz.</p>
<br>
						<p>
Today an untrained eye with little knowledge of jazz can take a look at these covers and understand that they are in fact related.</p>
<br>
							<p>
I personally like the aesthetics of the album covers I have found whilst researching this topic.
				</p>
			<br>
			<h2>
			Conclusion</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
			During the Fifties, when the design industry was in flux, Reid Miles pushed forward the way the typography is treated with his bold, playful designs, creative use of typefaces, and his distinct preference for contrast and asymmetry.

Personally, I’d like to think, that Reid Miles did the same to modern typography, as Charles and Ray Eames did to modern architecture and furniture.
			</p>
						<br>
			<p><i>
			"I think typography in the early Fifties was in a renaissance period anyway. It happened especially on album covers because they were not so restrictive as advertising.”
